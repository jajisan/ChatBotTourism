# ChatBotTourism
As part of my journey in AI and data science, I developed TourBot Buddy, a smart tourism segmentation engine that analyzes key visitor-centric factors across 325 of Indiaâ€™s top destinations. The goal was to inform tourism strategy, enhance user experience, and guide recommendation systems for virtual travel assistants.  What It Does:
Segments tourist destinations using KMeans clustering
Uses variables like Google reviews, entry fees, DSLR policies, airport proximity, visit timing, and cultural classification
Helps tourism platforms and startups like TripBuddy AI deliver personalized travel recommendations
Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
